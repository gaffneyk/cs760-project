      "Kaori is pursuing her career as a journalist for a magazine with great enthusiasm. But as a result of an article she wrote, she is sent to work for a community magazine at Fukuoka. An anonymous letter arrives, which puts her in contact with an old and forgotten theater, the 'Minato Theater' in nearby Shimonoseki. She also becomes acquainted with Shuhei Yasukawa, a popular performer of the early 60's, who used to sing and play the guitar during interludes. This was an epoch when the cinema was at the height of its popularity. She decides to write an article on him. While covering, she discovers the ups and downs of his life. His daughter, Misato plays an important role for him, but between them exists a deep split.",
